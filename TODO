- add popup menu for back/forward arrow toolbar button with the history from the 2 stacks on long click or right click: extend Browser class.
- build the preview last column in columns view, reuse the functionality in the right sidebar for others view. add metadata infos, rating, tagging.
- add toolbar editor
- add completion on the pathbar location, cf thunar they got a nice popup menu.
- start adding other signals for deleted files etc
