This is a short TODO list.

- middle click folder whould open in new tab.
- add completion on the pathbar location, cf thunar they got a nice popup menu.
- add emblems
- check dropbox support
- add thumbnails use tumbler, same logic as thunar request thumbs for only shown files.
- add an icon view
- files operations must implement an undo/redo mechanism.
- do the usual filecheck on files without extension of find a way that textfiles don't get detected as octet-stream
- store typechecks in db together with last edited date
- interface for tagging system, an easy way to tag a file in the preview panel
- dual panel mode? (like nautilus F3)
...


Postponed:
- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
