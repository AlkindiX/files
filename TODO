This is a short TODO list.

Hotlist:
- make permissions change async operations use jobs.
- PropertyWindow permissions change recursively for folders.
- make ContextPane support multi selection like PropertyWindow.
- update freespace diskrenderers in sidebar: make a simple timer and update the information at the application level for a determined time delay, and maybe after some specifics files operations ?
- use an overlay statusbar when ContextPane is off

Various:
- files operations must implement an undo/redo mechanism.
- interface for tagging system, an easy way to tag a file in the preview panel
- add drag support to the locationbar, we should be able to move a file by dragging it on the folder names
...


Postponed:
- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
