This is a short TODO list.

- add completion on the pathbar location, cf thunar they got a nice popup menu.
- add emblems
- add easy multiple selection with only the mouse +/- like in dolphin for all the views, use the pixbuff cellrenderer in list_view, use it to start rubberbanding too.
- change focus in the icon view: draw focus only via the text renderer
- check dropbox support
- files operations must implement an undo/redo mechanism.
- do the usual filecheck on files without extension of find a way that textfiles don't get detected as octet-stream
- store typechecks in db together with last edited date
- interface for tagging system, an easy way to tag a file in the preview panel
- dialog property of the selection.
...


Postponed:
- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
