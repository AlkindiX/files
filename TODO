This is a short TODO list.

- change focus in the icon view: draw focus only via the text renderer
- files operations must implement an undo/redo mechanism.
- do the usual filecheck on files without extension of find a way that textfiles don't get detected as octet-stream
- store typechecks in db together with last edited date
- interface for tagging system, an easy way to tag a file in the preview panel
- dialog property of the selection.
- add drag support to the locationbar, we should be able to move a file by dragging it on the folder names
...

Check:
- gof_file_get is unrefed in gof-file.c

Postponed:
- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
