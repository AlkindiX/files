This is a short TODO list.

Hotlist:
- icon view context menu, add Orderby menus
- make permissions change async operations use jobs.
- PropertyWindow permissions change recursively for folders.
- reshape file changed signals.
- make ContextPane support multi selection like PropertyWindow.
- files operations don't count on monitored changes fix bug in ftp etc.
- fix rename bug, edit label ctrl c+v  bug
- fix copy into bug since there s no ctrl+v shortcut for it (breadcrumbs regressions).
- update freespace diskrenderers in sidebar: make a simple timer and update the information at the application level for a determined time delay, and maybe after some specifics files operations ?
- use an overlay statusbar when ContextPane is off
- fix the breadcrumbs for uri navigation (regressions)
- store typechecks in db together with last edited date
- don't store thumbs with normal icons in the cache.
- sometimes marlin first launch is hanging, cut out all the non essential stuff (plugins marlin-daemon etc...) and check performances elements by elements.

Various:
- change focus in the icon view: draw focus only via the text renderer
- files operations must implement an undo/redo mechanism.
- do the usual filecheck on files without extension of find a way that textfiles don't get detected as octet-stream
- interface for tagging system, an easy way to tag a file in the preview panel
- add drag support to the locationbar, we should be able to move a file by dragging it on the folder names
...

Check:
- gof_file_get is unrefed in gof-file.c

Postponed:
- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
