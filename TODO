TODO:

- Make permissions change async operations use jobs.
- PropertyWindow permissions: change recursively for folders.
- Update freespace diskrenderers in sidebar: make a simple timer and update the information at the application level for a determined time delay, and maybe after some specifics files operations ?

For more planned features, look through the wishlist-marked bugs at https://bugs.launchpad.net/pantheon-files
