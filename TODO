This is a short TODO list.

- open in new tab, folder opened with middle click button.
- add popup menu for back/forward arrow toolbar button with the history from the 2 stacks on long click or right click: extend Browser class.
- add completion on the pathbar location, cf thunar they got a nice popup menu.
- start adding other signals for deleted files etc
- add drag & drop on the list view
- stop destroying the model for each view change, share the same model between all views.
- add emblems
- check dropbox support
- add thumbnails use tumbler, same logic as thunar request thumbs for only shown files.
- add an icon view
- add application api, managing all opened windows, use g_applicaion? libunique? own made socket api ala pcmanfm? expose api via dbus.
- add operation api, managing all the files operations. it must implement an undo/redo mechanism.- use app indicator for showing the progress operation window.
